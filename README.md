To test the program: 

1. Run main. 
2. Create at least 2 users.
3. List the users information.
4. Log in with username and password into one account. 
5. Deposit and withdraw money from your account and send money to other accounts.


The next things I'll work on are 1. Contingencies to handle input errors, 2. Following naming conventions in all the program and 3. Readability.
