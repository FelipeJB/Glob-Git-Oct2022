# Globant Bank application
> This project is an application which allows users to make transactions with their savings
accounts.

## Objectives

- The bank has many users, so there should be an option to print all clients and their related
information.
- Each client has a savings account, user and a password.
- Each bank account has an account number, an opening date and a balance.
- The user should be able to withdraw, add money, and transfer money to another bank
account.
- Some transactions are taxed the following way:
  - Withdrawals tax is $200 for amounts less than $1000. Withdrawals of more than $1000
  tax is $200 plus 15% of the amount to withdraw.
  - Adding money to the account does not have any cost.
  - Transferring money to another account tax is $100.
